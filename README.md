# Three lies I tell when teaching Python

Potential talk on teaching.

## The lies

1. How `import` works;
2. Why you should(n't) use chained comparisons (a < b < c);
3. Why you should(n't) use Unicode.
4. Is matching to mathematics the goal?

## Purpose

* Kickstarting discussion about how, why and when teaching should be subject specific.
* Talking about Guzdial's rules/ideas for how to teach computing.
* Having fun with some less obvious Python issues.
