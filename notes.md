# Three lies that I tell when teaching Python

1. import just runs the code in the module
2. Chained comparison operators and why they should(n't) be used
3. Unicode and why it should(n't) be used

## Import

Get quote

Go through the classic novice re-import problem

Script based fixes

Jupyter fix (or is it hiding it)?

## Chained comparison

a < x < y < b

Great: survey.

type(a) == type(b) in (float, int)

WTF?

Useful vs principle of least surprise vs what a mathematician should expect vs notation issues vs...

## Unicode

One in a million

Greek letters, doesn't cover all.

Internationalisation vs inclusion vs tooling problems vs standard practice.
