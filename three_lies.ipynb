One approach that avoids this issue is to not mix-and-match scripts and the console. If you start by getting the students to use the console, then switch *entirely* to coding in scripts before introducing the `import` statement. Especially if combined with a good IDE (like `spyder`, which tries to automatically re-import modules where needed), this substantially reduces the issue.

    "This is the fourth lie of three, and possibly the hardest to teach, although the concepts are quite easy. It boils down to an implicit assumption behind much of my earlier talk, which was \"Matching existing mathematical notation is good\". This assumed that scientists and mathematicians had settled on the clearest, most expressive notation, and that the job of computing is just to transfer the beauty of mathematics onto the computer so it can do the boring steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I admit, as a professional mathematician, this is definitely my bias. But there's been a lot of push-back from software developers to this viewpoint, and rightly so. To illustrate it, here's three functions, all of which multiply $x$ by $a$. The notational differences between the three are all on the left-hand-side and are tiny: however, to me, as a professional mathematician working in a small sub-field, they indicate large differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a case where expressing my assumptions in code will actually clarify my mathematical notation. The first function is a function of two variables. Although $a$ is typically used for constants and $x$ for variables, the way the function is written doesn't express that, so my mind sees a general function from $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function is different. The semi-colon indicates that I should think of the variable $a$ as being fixed within the context of this call. *However*, there may be other contexts where it varies. We are holding $a$ fixed while letting $x$ vary. The point is, there still is, somewhere, a function of two variables $(x, a)$, and in other contexts we may want to use this full function. When expressed in code (in Python, at least) we take our original function $f$ and enforce that $a$ takes a specific value, like 3. The function of two variables is still around, to use if we wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final function is different again. We're now thinking of $a$ as being fixed in *all* contexts. In this case, there *is no* function of two variables: there is only ever a function of one variable, defined in terms of some constant $a$, presently unspecified. As soon as we specify $a$, enforcing that it takes a specific value like 3, the function of $x$ is fixed. Considering how the function varies as $a$ does *makes no sense*. We can express this in Python using functional tricks: a function takes `a` as input, and returns a function of `x` alone. At no point have we ever defined a function of two variables."

It doesn't make sense to try and avoid them - the field moves too fast, and breaks too many things along the way. Instead we need to enjoy playing with the dragons, be performative and creative with our students when we debug the problems and come across surprises, and never stop interrogating the approaches, even when teaching the simplest things."
